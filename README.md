This is the starter repo for the RobotWarz assignment.

Included are:

* RobotBase.h and RobotBase.cpp - these files will be the basis for your robot and will determine what the arena does with them. Do not change them. If you find a bug, discuss it with the instructor. 
* some .drawio  example diagrams that you can use to guide your design work. 
* some sample Robots - Ratboy and Flame_e_o that you can use to see how robots work
* a test robot program that will load your robot and ensure that it responds correctly when the arena calls its functions.
* a Makefile that makes the test_robot executable linking Robot Base. You can extend this Makefile to make your arena as well. 
* the specification for the RobotWarz assignment.
* the class definition for the RadarObj that will be used by the Arena and the Robot to scan the arena for obstacles and other robots.

Instructions:

1. Do not make changes in these files: 
    * RobotBase.h
    * RobotBase.cpp
    * RadarObj.h

2. Add whatever other classes and files you need to complete the arena. Do not add dependencies to any additional robots you make - they must be stock and portable to other arenas.
3. Your executable must be RobotWarz (but you can name all the rest of the files whatever you want.)
4. This is your personal assignment repo - you can push as often as you like.
5. Report any bugs in the starter code to me by creating a github issue and assigning it to me.

Hints:

- Build a skeleton structure first. Break the problem into manageable chunks.
- This assignment will take you a long time and you will need to iterate on it. If you wait till the last minute you will not be able to finish.
- Look at the sequence diagram to help you understand Robot/Arena interaction.
- Use AI, but don't just feed it the spec. Instead build a structure and ask the AI to help you flesh it out. Get the AI to do the drudgery while you do the thinking.
